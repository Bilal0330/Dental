<p>Primary teeth give shape to your child’s face, help guide permanent teeth into the right position and are needed for
learning to eat and to speak. It’s important to care for them well.</p>

<p>All teeth have an outer layer of enamel (a thin, hard, white substance that covers the tooth). This layer of enamel of
pri teeth is thinner than the enamel of permanent teeth. This puts them at risk for tooth decay, which can begin
even before the first tooth appears. Early childhood tooth decay is decay that affects the primary teeth in children
less than 6 years of age.

Decay is caused by bacteria and happens more easily if teeth often come into contact with sweet liquids—such as formula,
milk, juice, and even breast milk (which contains sugar)—and are not cleaned regularly. Breast milk is the healthiest,
and decay can be prevented by cleaning your baby’s teeth after breastfeeding and before putting the baby to sleep.

Early childhood tooth decay can affect your child’s health and cause pain, making it hard for your child to sleep, eat
or speak. It can also affect your child’s ability to concentrate and learn. Children who develop dental decay at an
early age are more likely to suffer from it throughout childhood.
