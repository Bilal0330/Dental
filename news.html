    <h2>Dental Leadership Network champions health and wellbeing in the dental team</h2>
    <p>The Dental Leadership Network (DLN) convened at Woburn House in London on 12 June to spotlight the crucial role
        of dental leaders in promoting health and wellbeing within the profession.

        The event gathered experts to share insights and strategies for fostering a supportive and inclusive work
        environment.

        The conference featured an impressive lineup of speakers, including Safiyyah Yacoobali and Sophia Morris from
        the Diversity in Dentistry Action Group (DDAG) on the importance of creating a culture of belonging and
        inclusion in the dental workplace.

        Zain Hameed, Dental Core Trainee 2, Community and Special Care Dentistry at Barts Health NHS Trust, discussed
        managing a chronic health condition in dentistry. Dr Mahrukh Khwaja, Founder of Mind Ninja, delved into
        resilience strategies, highlighting both team and individual interventions, and shared data from the NHS
        Midlands pilot resilience programme.

        Another highlight of the event was a panel discussion on mental health wellness in the workplace, facilitated by
        Catherine Rutland, Clinical Director at Simply Health. The panel, made up of Wendy Duncan, National Dental
        Education and Training Officer, BADT; Theresa Thorp, Executive Director, Regulation, GDC; and Neena Manek,
        Dentolegal Adviser at MDDUS, explored essential support frameworks for dental professionals, emphasising the
        importance of mental health in maintaining a thriving work environment.

        Colin MacKenzie, GDC Head of Nations and Engagement, moderated a discussion focused on the link between a
        healthy dental team and exceptional patient care. Panelists at that discussion included Catherine Tannahill,
        Director of Clinician Engagement at Portman Dentex Dental Care; Mark Oâ€™Hagan, Director of People at Community
        Dental Services CIC; Stuart Johnson, an active member of the Lancashire and South Cumbria Local Dental
        Committees; and Ian Wilson, Training Programme Director at NHS England. They highlighted best practices for
        ensuring the wellbeing of dental teams to enhance patient outcomes.</p>
